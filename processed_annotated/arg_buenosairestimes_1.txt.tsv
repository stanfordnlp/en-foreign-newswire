We	O
woke	O
reasonably	O
late	O
following	O
the	O
feast	O
and	O
free	O
flowing	O
wine	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
.	O

After	O
gathering	O
ourselves	O
and	O
our	O
packs	O
,	O
we	O
headed	O
down	O
to	O
our	O
homestay	O
family	O
's	O
small	O
dining	O
room	O
for	O
breakfast	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
enjoyed	O
scrambled	O
eggs	O
,	O
toast	O
,	O
mekitsi	O
(	O
fried	O
dough	O
)	O
,	O
local	O
jam	O
and	O
peppermint	O

We	O
were	O
making	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
Rila	B-Location
Mountains	I-Location
,	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
visiting	O
the	O
Rila	B-Location
Monastery	I-Location
.	O


We	O
wandered	O
the	O
site	O
with	O
busloads	O
of	O
other	O
tourists	O
,	O
yet	O
strangely	O
the	O
place	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
crowded	O
.	O

I	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
sheer	O
size	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
or	O
whether	O
the	O
masses	O
congregated	O
in	O
one	O
area	O
and	O
didn	O
't	O
venture	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
main	O
church	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
didn	O
't	O
feel	O
overwhelmed	O
by	O
tourists	O
in	O
the	O
monastery	O
.	O


Headed	O
over	O
Lions	B-Facility
Bridge	I-Facility
and	O
made	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
Sofia	B-Facility
Synagogue	I-Facility
,	O
then	O
sheltered	O
in	O
the	O
Central	B-Facility
Market	I-Facility
Hall	I-Facility
until	O
the	O
recurrent	O
(	O
but	O
short	O
-	O
lived	O
)	O
mid	O
-	O
afternoon	O
rain	O
passed	O
.	O


Feeling	O
refreshed	O
after	O
an	O
espresso	O
,	O
we	O
walked	O
a	O
short	O
distance	O
to	O
the	O
small	O
but	O
welcoming	O
Banya	B-Facility
Bashi	I-Facility
Mosque	I-Facility
,	O
then	O
descended	O
into	O
the	O
ancient	O
Serdica	B-Facility
complex	I-Facility
.	O


We	O
were	O
exhausted	O
after	O
a	O
long	O
day	O
of	O
travel	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
headed	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
hotel	O
and	O
crashed	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
low	O
expectations	O
about	O
Sofia	B-Location
as	O
a	O
city	O
,	O
but	O
after	O
the	O
walking	O
tour	O
I	O
absolutely	O
loved	O
the	O
place	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
an	O
easy	O
city	O
to	O
navigate	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
beautiful	O
city	O
despite	O
its	O
ugly	O
,	O
staunch	O
and	O
stolid	O
communist	O
-	O
built	O
surrounds	O
.	O

Sofia	B-Location
has	O
a	O
very	O
average	O
facade	O
as	O
you	O
enter	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
but	O
once	O
you	O
lose	O
yourself	O
in	O
the	O
old	O
town	O
area	O
,	O
everything	O
changes	O
